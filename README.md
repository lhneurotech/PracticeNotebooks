# PracticeNotebooks: Software Onboarding

Welcome to the team! As part of your onboarding process, we've prepared a set of notebooks that cover essential concepts and libraries we will frequently use in our projects.

## Getting Started

**1. Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning the Repository to your local machine.

**2. Work Through the Notebooks:** Navigate through each Notebook. These are designed to give a introductory understanding into the libraries and concepts we will use.

**3. Experiment and Practice:** Some of the Notebooks will give some tasks to practice with. Work through those and don't be afraid to ask questions. 

**4. Give Feedback:** If there is something you would like to know about, let the team know! Our goal is help you gain a solid understanding of the concepts and tools we will use.
